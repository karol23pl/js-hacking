# js-hacking
My trip in the world of java script.

## Welcome!
Enjoy looking in my projects like Carl-culator or uhhh Kari-clock.

I'm bassicly trying to learn javascript in a fun way.

### How to commit? (for me)

 1. `git add -u` - add all modified files
 2. `git commit –amend` - change commit name
 3. `git add [file name]` - upload another file
 4. `git commit` - describe your changes
 5. `git push` - send changes to github.com
